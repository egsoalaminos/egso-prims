/**
 * A document shown on screen at the size it comes out of the printer.
 *
 * The records forms are recreations of National Archives paper, and the office
 * is accountable for the paper. Summarising one into cards and revealing the
 * form itself only in the print dialog put a step between the clerk and the
 * document they are answerable for; this puts the sheet on the page.
 *
 * The dimensions are the real ones — A4 is 210mm x 297mm and the padding is
 * the margin the printed @page uses — so the screen is at the same scale as
 * the paper. CSS millimetres are physical units, so the browser does that
 * conversion itself and no scaling factor has to be maintained here.
 *
 * It never prints. Printing is still done by the portalled [data-print-form],
 * which is what escapes the app's fixed-height frame; this copy carries
 * data-print-hide so a page holding both puts only one of them on paper.
