/**
 * System configuration domain types.
 *
 * Every setting lives in one table and is declared once here; the Settings
 * page renders from this registry rather than hardcoding a form, so adding a
 * setting means adding an entry and a seed row — no new service code.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR THIS REGISTRY: a setting earns its place by changing something.
 * Each entry below names, in its `note`, the module behaviour it drives. An
 * earlier version of this file carried thirty-seven settings of which roughly
 * twenty-five were read by nothing at all — a Settings page that looked
 * thorough and configured almost nothing. Those are gone. If a new setting
 * cannot say what it changes, it does not belong here yet.
