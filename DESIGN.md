# Design System: GSO PRIMS Staff Portal

> **Scope.** This file documents the **staff portal** (every route under `/portal`), which is the current design going forward. There is no older portal look to return to.
>
> **The admin application (everything behind `/login`) has not been migrated.** It still runs its older design (the 4 August 2026 system in the top half of `src/index.css`: near-black accent, 10px-derived corners, Inter only). The admin is next to be redesigned. Until that happens, nothing here applies to admin screens.
>
> **How the portal's values are applied.** Nothing here is global. The portal's colours, corners and ground are declared in one scoped `[data-portal]` token block ("THE PORTAL" in `src/index.css`). The portal layout puts `data-portal` on its root element, and on `<html>` while it is mounted, so pickers and selects portalled to `<body>` pick up the same values. The theme is `@theme inline`, so utilities compile straight to `--radius-step-*`, `--canvas` and `--accent-*`. Those are the names the scope redeclares, and every value in it is a literal, never `var(...)`.

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Service Counter"**

The portal is a municipal service counter that fits on one screen. Staff from other offices come to do one of two things: start a filing (Purchase Request, Requisition and Issue Slip, Facility Reservation) or follow one they already filed. The layout reads like a government letterhead. A thin crimson strip names the Republic and the Province. A white masthead carries the seal and the office name. A crimson band asks one question. The service cards sit across the band's lower edge. Nothing else on the page competes with the services.

The look is calm and plain, and it stays in its category on purpose. Deep municipal crimson is the one colour with a voice. The owner chose it because it is easy on the eyes, and it marks identity and the act of starting a filing. Ink (near-black) marks tracking. Everything else is white cards with hairline borders on a cool light-grey ground, with 4px corners and no shadows. The owner rejected two looks: a marketing hero, and an editorial, university-style direction with a serif display headline, a bright crimson hero and a ruled list. Harvard was only ever a colour reference.

The portal is light mode only. There is no dark mode and no theme switcher.

**Key Characteristics:**
- One crimson (#7e1624) for identity and "start a filing"; ink for "track".
- A letterhead masthead: seal, municipality line, and the office name in Spectral. That is the only serif.
- White cards with 1px hairlines on a cool grey ground (#f6f7f8). Flat, with no shadows.
- 4px corners on every surface, control and tile.
- The home page fits one screen with no scrolling at 1366x768 and at 390x844.
- The filing wizards are shared with the admin and are never edited for the portal. The scope restyles them.

## Colors

The palette is one restrained crimson on a cool neutral field. The accent covers the strip and the band. Inside the content area it covers only the actions that start a filing.

### Primary
- **Municipal Crimson** (#7e1624): the government strip, the question band on the home page, the title band on every inner page, and the "start a filing" actions (the action bar on each filing card, the phone go-button, primary buttons inside the wizards). Also used as text for the current service in the nav, filing-card icons, and the phone call-to-action line. It appears as bands and actions, never as a bright field. The owner chose this value.
- **Crimson Deep** (#66111d): the hover state of every crimson action.
- **Crimson Focus** (#b0415a): the focus ring on crimson and neutral controls (5.6:1 against white, 5.2:1 against the ground).
- **Crimson Wash** (#f6eced): the subtle accent tint, reached through `--accent-subtle` by shared components (the sticky table header band, soft accent surfaces) when they render inside the scope.

### Neutral
- **Ink** (#171717): the tracking action and its focus ring, headings, and input text. Hover goes to **Ink Press** (#000000).
- **Cool Ground** (#f6f7f8): the page canvas under the band and cards. It is slightly cooler than the admin's canvas so white cards read against it.
- **Card White** (#ffffff): cards, the masthead, the footer, and inputs.
- **Hairline** (#e5e5e5): every card border, the masthead's bottom rule, the footer's top rule, and the rule between the masthead and the phone nav. **Hairline Strong** (#d4d4d4) is the card border on hover and the border of the reference-number receipt.
- **Field Stroke** (#a3a3a3): the resting border of text inputs. It is heavier than the card hairline so a field reads as a field.
- **Text Body** (#262626) / **Nav Idle** (#525252) / **Text Muted** (#737373): value text, idle nav links, and descriptions, captions, the municipality line and the footer.
- **Tile Grey** (#f5f5f5): the 40px icon tile on each service card, and the nav link hover.
- **Panel Grey** (#fafafa): inset panels inside a white card (the track result's office/update panel, the reference receipt).
- **Error** (#dc2626 stroke, #b91c1c text): an invalid field's border, with its message directly beneath it.

Neutrals come from Tailwind's stock `neutral` ramp (declared in oklch; the hex values above are exact conversions).

### Named Rules
**The Stateable Colour Rule.** Every colour must carry a meaning a clerk could say out loud. Crimson means "this is the office" or "start a document". Ink means "follow a document". Red means "this field is wrong" or "this request was stopped" (rejected or cancelled). If you can't state what a colour means, don't use it.

**The Crimson Is Not a Field Rule.** Crimson appears as the thin strip, the band behind a heading, and solid action buttons. It is never a large bright surface, a card fill, or a background for body copy. The band's height responds to the viewport so the cards, not the crimson, stay the focus.

**The Scoped Palette Rule.** Portal colours reach components only through the `[data-portal]` block's `--accent-*` and `--canvas` literals. Never hard-code the crimson into a shared component, and never declare a portal value as `var(--other-token)`.

## Typography

**Body Font:** Inter (with ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif), weights 400/500/600/700
**Letterhead Font:** Spectral 500 (with ui-serif, Georgia, serif), used for the office name only

**Character:** Plain, legible Inter does all the work, the way a government form does. Spectral appears once, on "General Services Office", where a letterhead would set the office name.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (600, 26px on phones / 32px from md, -0.01em, balanced wrap): the single question on the home band, in white.
- **Headline** (600, 24px / 28px from md, -0.01em): the page title on an inner page's band, in white.
- **Letterhead** (Spectral 500, 20px, tight leading): the office name in the masthead. Nowhere else.
- **Title** (600, 15px on phones / 17px from sm, snug leading): service card titles and the track result heading. All four home cards share this line box, so their headings sit on one baseline.
- **Body Lead** (400, 15px, white at 85%): the one supporting sentence under a band heading.
- **Body** (400, 14px, relaxed leading): card descriptions, nav links (14px), and input text.
- **Action** (600, 14px): the labels on the 44px crimson and ink action bars.
- **Small** (13px): phone call-to-action lines, the "All services" back link, and result detail lines.
- **Meta** (12–12.5px): the government strip, receipt captions, field errors, and the footer.
- **Letterhead line** (500, 11.5px, uppercase, 0.1em tracking, muted): "Municipality of Alaminos, Laguna" above the office name. It belongs to the masthead lockup only.

### Named Rules
**The One Serif Rule.** Spectral sets the office name and nothing else. Headings, questions, titles and numbers are all Inter.

**The Literal Sizes Rule.** Type sizes are written as literal pixel values on the element (14px, 17px, 32px), not remapped through tokens. Don't bulk-rewrite them.

**The Tabular Reference Rule.** Reference numbers (PR-2026-000214) are set with tabular figures. Inputs for them display in capitals while the placeholder stays in sentence case.

## Layout

**Frame.** From top to bottom: the government strip, the masthead, main content, and the footer. The strip, masthead and footer each span the full width, with contents centred at a 1200px maximum and 20px side gutters (32px from md). The page is at least one dynamic viewport tall (`100dvh`), and main content flexes to fill it.

**Home page (one screen).** The crimson band holds the question. Its top padding is `clamp(2.5rem, 8vh, 6rem)` and its bottom padding is `clamp(8rem, 18vh, 12rem)` from sm; phones get a fixed 28px/56px. The card grid is pulled up over the band's lower edge by 88px from sm, and by 36px on phones. The grid is one column on phones (10px gap), two columns from sm (20px gap), and four columns from lg: three filing cards, then the tracking card. A tall screen fills with band, not with an empty gap under the cards. The home page must fit on one screen with no scrolling at 1366x768 and at 390x844.

**How-it-works steps (desktop home).** From lg, the band carries three numbered steps under the lead sentence, 32px below it: "Choose a service", "Complete the form", "Keep your reference number to track it". Each number sits in a 28px circle with a 1px border at 45% white; the text is 14px at 90% white; a 40px hairline at 35% white leads into steps 2 and 3. It is an ordered list of exactly three items labelled "How it works", with the numbers and rules hidden from assistive technology. It replaced two group labels ("File a request", "Track a request") that only restated the cards, chosen by the owner over a large faint seal in the band because the sequence helps a first-time filer. It is hidden below lg, where it would push the tracking card off a phone screen.

**Phone home.** Below sm, each filing card becomes a single row: the icon tile, the title, a crimson call-to-action line, and a 36px crimson circular go-button. The description and action bar are hidden. The tracking card drops its icon tile and keeps its field and button. All four services stay on one phone screen.

**Inner pages.** Each page gets a band with "All services", the title and an optional description, then content on the ground below with 32px of vertical padding. The band text and the content share one measure, so the title starts on the content's left edge. There are three measures: **wide** (1200px, for the reservation calendar), **form** (52rem: the wizards' 48rem cap plus the container's gutters), and **narrow** (42rem, for tracking). Inner pages do not repeat the home page's card-over-band overlap.

**Service navigation.** The home page has no nav bar; the cards are the navigation, and the masthead's right side shows the system name from lg. On inner pages the service nav sits on the right of the masthead from lg. Below lg it moves under a hairline as four equal columns, so no service is ever cut off.

**Rhythm.** Controls are 44px tall. Cards are padded 24px (14–16px on phones). Icon tile to title is 20px, title to description is 6px, and description to action bar is 24px.

### Named Rules
**The One Screen Rule.** On the home page, the services and the tracking field are all visible without scrolling at 1366x768 and at 390x844. Anything added to the home page has to fit inside that constraint or not be added. Fitting means not one pixel over: a 1px overflow still lets the page scroll. The portal also turns off elastic overscroll (`overscroll-behavior: none` on `html[data-portal]` and its body), so a trackpad or phone swipe does not drag the whole frame, strip and all, away from the top of the window.

## Elevation & Depth

The portal is flat. No surface casts a shadow: the card elevation token resolves to `none`, and no portal element adds one. Depth comes from three things only. White cards sit on the cool grey ground. Cards are ruled with a 1px hairline. The card row overlaps the crimson band, which puts the services physically in front of the question.

### Named Rules
**The Hairline, Not Shadow Rule.** A card is separated from its ground by a 1px #e5e5e5 border and nothing else. Hover darkens the border to #d4d4d4. It never lifts the card.

## Shapes

Every corner is 4px. The `[data-portal]` scope collapses all seven radius steps (`sm` through `4xl`) to 4px, so shared components that ask for `rounded-lg` or `rounded-xl` get 4px inside the portal. That covers cards, buttons, inputs, icon tiles, nav links, the receipt and the focus-ring outline. The circles are the 36px crimson go-button on a phone filing row, which reads as a single tap target at the end of the row, the numbered how-it-works steps, and the 28px markers on a tracked request's progress list. Borders are always 1px. Focus is a 2px ring with a 2px offset.

## Components

### Buttons
Solid, full-height bars that say what they do and point where they go.
- **Shape:** 4px corners, 44px tall, 16px horizontal padding, label left and an 18px arrow right (`justify-between`) when the button fills its card.
- **File (crimson):** #7e1624 with white 14px/600 text. It darkens to #66111d on hover. On a filing card the whole card is the link, and the bar is its last line, not a second control.
- **Track (ink):** #171717 with white 14px/600 text. It goes to #000000 on hover, and its focus ring is ink.
- **Hover / Press:** the arrow nudges 3px right on hover (150ms ease-out). Press scales to 0.98. Transitions cover only colour and transform.
- **Secondary:** a white fill with a 1px hairline, body-coloured text, and #fafafa on hover. Used next to a primary button, for example "Back to Portal" on the receipt.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 4px.
- **Background:** white on the cool ground.
- **Shadow Strategy:** none (see Elevation & Depth).
- **Border:** 1px #e5e5e5, going to #d4d4d4 on hover for linked cards.
- **Internal Padding:** 24px from sm. Phone rows use 14px, and the tracking card uses 16px.
- **Arrival:** home cards fade in and rise 8px once, in reading order: 360ms, 40ms stagger, ease `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`. With reduced motion, they appear in place. Nothing loops.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** white fill, 1px #a3a3a3 stroke, 4px corners, 44px tall, 14px left padding, 14px text.
- **Focus:** the border goes to ink, plus a 2px ink ring at 15% opacity.
- **Error:** the border goes to #dc2626 with a matching 15% ring, and a 12.5px #b91c1c message appears directly below, announced as an alert. Every field has a real label; the home tracking card uses its description as the label.

### Navigation
- **Style:** 14px Inter links with 8px/12px padding and 4px corners.
- **Idle / Hover:** #525252 text; hover goes to ink on #f5f5f5.
- **Current:** crimson text at weight 600, with no underline, pill or fill.
- **Mobile and tablet:** below lg, a row under the masthead of four equal columns, one per service, at 13px with centred text and 48px tall cells. It fits every phone without scrolling; the one long label, "Purchase Request", wraps to two lines. It replaced a sideways-scrolling row with a drawn scroll bar, which the owner found a patch: the row cut Track off at the edge. A "Skip to content" link comes first in the tab order.

### Government Strip and Letterhead Masthead (signature)
The strip is a full-width crimson bar with 12px white text: "Republic of the Philippines" on the left and "Province of Laguna" on the right (the right text is hidden on phones). Below it, the white masthead holds the 44px municipal seal, the uppercase municipality line, and the office name in Spectral, all linking home. The masthead is ruled off with a hairline. The footer mirrors it: a 24px seal, the office line, and the copyright, in 12.5px muted text on white.

### Service Card (signature)
The home page's unit. It has a 40px grey icon tile (a crimson icon for a filing, an ink icon for tracking) and the document's reference prefix (PR, RIS, FR) at the top right in 12px/600 muted text. Below come the title, a description, and the action bar. The tracking card takes the reference number directly on the home page and opens the tracking page already searching.

### Title Band (signature)
The home band's structure is reused at the top of every inner page: crimson, a white 13px "All services" back link with a left arrow, a 24/28px title, and an optional 15px description at 85% white. The band is the only place a page's title appears.

### Reference Receipt
Shown after a filing is submitted. It is a white card, max width 36rem. It shows the reference number in 18px/600 tabular figures inside a #fafafa panel with a #d4d4d4 border, a line telling the person to keep the number, and a primary "Track this request" button next to a secondary "Back to Portal".

### Compact Reservation Calendar
Below lg, the Reserve page swaps the admin's month grid (760px minimum, which scrolled sideways on a phone) for a compact month that answers one question: is this date taken? The admin calendar is shared and unchanged; from lg it still shows.
- **Header:** "Reservation Calendar" at 15px/600 with a hairline "Today" button beside it; below, 44px hairline previous and next buttons around the month name at 15px/600.
- **Days:** a seven-column grid of 44px day buttons (they shrink with their column on narrow phones), 14px tabular numbers, days outside the month left blank. The selected day is ink with white text; today, when not selected, has a 1px ink outline. Selection switches instantly, with no transition, because it is tapped often.
- **Booking dots:** a 7px dot under the number when a facility is held that day. Filled means approved (or completed), a ring means waiting for approval, both in ink, with a legend under the grid. Rejected, cancelled and draft bookings hold nothing and are not shown.
- **Selected day:** under the grid on a phone, beside it from md. The day as a 15px/600 heading, then each booking: facility name (14px/500) with its status at 12.5px on the same line, and the time and office below at 13px tabular. With none, "No bookings on this day."

### Tracked Request
The Track page's result, one white card under the reference field. A request that is not found is a field error on that field (red border, 12.5px message, focus returned), not a separate card.
- **Heading:** the document type in muted 500 weight, a middle dot, and the reference number in tabular figures, at 17px. On a phone the type and the number take a line each.
- **Status tag:** the status in words at 13px/600 inside a 32px, 4px-cornered, 1px-bordered tag with an icon: a clock while it moves, a check once every step is done, both in ink; an X in red on a red-50 fill when it was stopped. Which of the three is read from the steps, not from a list of status names.
- **Now at / Last update:** a two-column definition list (one column on a phone) between hairline rules, with 13px muted labels in sentence case and 14px/500 ink values. No uppercase labels and no grey panel.
- **Progress:** an ordered list. Done is an ink circle with a white check, and the rule below it is ink, so the line shows how far the request has come. The step with the office now is an ink outline with an ink dot, `aria-current="step"`, and a grey "In progress" tag. Not yet is a #d4d4d4 outline on a #d4d4d4 rule with muted text. Stopped is a red circle with a white X. Each step can carry its time (12.5px tabular, right-aligned from sm), the person and office (13px), and remarks in a #fafafa box with a hairline. No avatars.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** use Municipal Crimson (#7e1624) only for identity (strip, bands) and for actions that start a filing. Use ink (#171717) for actions that follow one.
- **Do** make sure every colour carries a meaning a clerk could state.
- **Do** keep the home page to one screen with no scrolling at 1366x768 and 390x844.
- **Do** separate surfaces with 1px hairlines on the cool ground (#f6f7f8), with 4px corners throughout.
- **Do** restyle shared admin components and filing wizards only through the `[data-portal]` token scope, with literal values.
- **Do** give inner pages the crimson title band and match the band's measure to the content below it (wide, form or narrow).
- **Do** make controls 44px tall with a visible 2px focus ring (#b0415a for crimson and neutral controls, ink for ink controls).
- **Do** keep motion to a single entrance (8px rise, 360ms or less, strong ease-out) and honour reduced motion.

### Don't:
- **Don't** add a dark mode, a theme switcher or an alternate portal palette. The portal is light mode only.
- **Don't** edit the shared filing wizards (Purchase Request, Requisition and Issue Slip, Reservation) to change how they look in the portal.
- **Don't** apply portal tokens globally or to admin routes. The admin keeps its own design until it is redesigned.
- **Don't** use crimson as a bright field, a card fill or a text background.
- **Don't** add shadows to cards, buttons or bands.
- **Don't** set anything but the office name in Spectral, and don't use a serif display headline.
- **Don't** build a marketing hero or an editorial, university-style layout (serif display, bright crimson hero, ruled filing lists).
- **Don't** add a colour that stands for nothing, such as a decorative second accent or a tinted card per service.
